# 3Dgo
This is a 3D implementation of Go done for a CS 488 - Graphics project. 

Windows binary: http://www.almostmatt.com/3D%20Go.zip  
I'm not entirely certain that I have all of the dependent dll/libs included. Let me know whether or not it works for you if you try it.

You can pick up stones with the mouse and then drop them by clicking again. S toggles an outline effect.

The rules of go are not implemented, instead it is more of a sand box in which you could play Go. Since it was done for an assignment I also implemented my own collision handling, which means that it behaves a bit imperfectly in some cases.
